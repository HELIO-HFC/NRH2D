NRH2D V1.04 README
------------------

This directory containing the source files of the NRH2D code, which is dedicated to
the radio sources detection on 2d reconstructed images of the Nancay RadioHeliograph (NRH) .
The detection algorithm has been developped by Christian Renie (LESIA), and is currently available in the
SSW/NRH package.
Adaptation of the code for the HFC needs has been done by Xavier Bonnin (LESIA).

To launch the code, edit then run the nrhd2_launcher.batch file in IDL.

Note: Before running the code, be sure that SSW with NRH library package is compiled, and that the configuration file (which should be on the config/ directory) is correctly set.
